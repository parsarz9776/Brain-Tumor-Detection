# Brain-Tumor-Detection- 
Many people throughout the world are suffering from brain tumors and unfortunately, diagnostic errors play a significant role in patient deaths.
Also, a significant portion of the world population lacks adequate access to radiology specialists.
Although tumor detection and classification are completely challenging task and takes up too much time, artificial intelligence (AI) based methods show high potential in diagnosis purposes. 
These methods are accurate and fast enough to allow specialists to perform tumor detection more easily. In this project, convolutional neural network (CNN) as a deep learning technique is used on brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) images to detect a brain Tumor and then classify them into 4 different classes(types) that we have in our dataset.
